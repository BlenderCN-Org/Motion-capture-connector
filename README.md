# Motion capture armature retarget addon for Blender 2.82

Due to the lack of BVH retargetting tools in Blender 2.8, I’ve written a few script for my personal use. Now I decided to release it as a Blender 2.8 extension for the others.

It’s still in the early stages, but it works fine with the following limitations.

It can retarget BVH animation to MB-Lab basic/muscular armatures, Makehuman cmudb rigs and partial Rigify FK.

For installation just download and install MocapConnerctor.zip in Blender preferences.
